# YoshLegacyCombat (1.21.4+)
PaperMC plugin to replicate 1.7/1.8 combat, PacketEvents needs to be running on the server, takes advantage of consumable data component added in 1.21.4 to bring back Sword Blocking.

# Features
- Any sword you use automatically becomes blockable, blocking reduces incoming damage by 50%
- Increased hitbox sizes to match <= 1.8.x
- No attack cooldown
- No more hit sounds added in 1.9
- Custom player knockback system
- Fishing rod, eggs and snowballs give knockback to players
- Old health regen when hunger bar is full
- No more sweep and health indicator particles

# TODO list
- Make damage and protection more accurate to 1.8 maybe?
